1. Depth first search will find an answer faster, since it doesn't iterate through every neighbor of a node unless it has to, while breadth first will search through almost every node until it finds a match2. The worst case of Breadth-first search is O(|V| + |E|), where V is the number of verticies and E is the number of edges or connections. This is because at the worst possible case, breadth first search will go through every node in the graph, also checking every connection between them.3. 4.
