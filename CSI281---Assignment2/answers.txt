1.  The Big-O runtime for randomIntArray() is O(n) because the function
loops through the array one time.

2.  The Big-O runtime for arraySearchSpeed() is O(n + log(n) + nlog(n))
because the speed test combines linear search [O(n)] and binary search 
[O(log(n) + nlog(n))], so the times are added together to get 
O(n + log(n) + nlog(n)).

3. 
Binary Search Formula: 10 * log(N) * number_of_searches + (12 * N * log(N))
Linear Search Formula: 5 * N * number_of_searches

The point at which these two lines intersect is 31.975, meaning that the
32nd search will be faster to sort the list and use binary search
