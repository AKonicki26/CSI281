1.  The Big-O runtime for randomIntArray() is O(n) because the function
loops through the array one time.

2.  The Big-O runtime for arraySearchSpeed() is O(n + log(n) + nlog(n))
because the speed test combines linear search [O(n)] and binary search 
[O(log(n) + nlog(n))], so the times are added together to get 
O(n + log(n) + nlog(n)).
